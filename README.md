Feel free to reuse the code for any project.

## Setup

Run `npm install && npm setup` and replace the access token in `astro.config.mjs` with the one from your newly created space.

## Setting up the Storyblok Block Schema

You may use `storyblok-components.json` and the [push-components command of the Storyblok CLI](https://github.com/storyblok/storyblok-cli#push-components) in order to recreate the block schema.
